Ask "create a git branch from a tag" and get the exact commands you need. Clify converts natural language into executable terminal commands using AI.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
brew tap aktagon/clify https://github.com/aktagon/clify
brew install clify

# Configure with your Anthropic API key
clify setup

# Ask questions
clify "find large files in current directory"
```

**Output:**

```
ðŸŸ¡ find . -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
    Find files larger than 100MB and show their sizes

ðŸŸ¢ du -ah . | sort -hr | head -20
    Show top 20 largest files and directories by size

ðŸŸ¢ ls -laSh | head -20
    List files sorted by size (largest first)
```

## Why Choose Clify?

| Tool      | Strengths                              | Limitations           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Clify** | AI-powered, contextual, conversational | Requires API key      |
| `tldr`    | Fast, offline, community examples      | Limited coverage      |
| `man`     | Comprehensive documentation            | Complex, overwhelming |

Clify understands context, suggests alternatives, and adapts to your operating system automatically.
